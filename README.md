# TFT Stats Tool
## Inspiration 
At a Data Science careers event, I heard about a project that involved analysing statistics for league of legends matches using the riot API. This inspired me to create something similar but for a game I play, Teamfight Tactics (TFT), which was also developed by riot. 
I also wanted to learn C++.
